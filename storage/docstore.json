He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.[12]\r\n\r\nIn 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[13] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[14] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[16] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[14]\r\n\r\nOn 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[14][17] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.[11][18] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[14] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[19]\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nMain article: Career of Virat Kohli\r\nPlayer profile\r\nComparisons to Sachin Tendulkar\r\nKohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's \"successor\",[20][21] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[22][23] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[24] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[25] He has been lauded as the \"new king of world cricket\" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2879, "end_char_idx": 5975, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2739c15f-2d43-4cac-9c8b-eb79d67e8b3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2739c15f-2d43-4cac-9c8b-eb79d67e8b3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\akash\\Learn-GEN_AI\\Llamaindex_with_gemini\\QA_System\\Data\\virat.txt", "file_name": "virat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19143, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd25cc95-baae-4c05-a8a0-46789f16a22c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\akash\\Learn-GEN_AI\\Llamaindex_with_gemini\\QA_System\\Data\\virat.txt", "file_name": "virat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19143, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "2079d2105dec34d845ab8dbe159fc0d336c49c77482ef105c8a8192d08850cb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "751001fc-b277-4a68-9113-dab71da4309a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\akash\\Learn-GEN_AI\\Llamaindex_with_gemini\\QA_System\\Data\\virat.txt", "file_name": "virat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19143, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "a4f75f42a4f44a5bfdbde55d749cdd39a5ece00b2d744495a8a8d435c589b86c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3cc5ae7-9fc9-4018-a935-8db5f4f724e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ba34df87dd0a380ccd2a7fb4bc28a41eb7c87e0ca8d31a634756385107bd970", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[26] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[27] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[28]\r\n\r\nIn a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[29] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.[30]\r\n\r\nPlaying style\r\nKohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[31][32] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[33] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[34][35] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[36][37]\r\n\r\n\r\nKohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup\r\nKohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[12] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[38] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[39] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[40]\r\n\r\nHowever, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[41] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[42] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[43][44] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[45][46] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[47]\r\n\r\nKohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados alike.[48][49] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5975, "end_char_idx": 9385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3cc5ae7-9fc9-4018-a935-8db5f4f724e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3cc5ae7-9fc9-4018-a935-8db5f4f724e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\akash\\Learn-GEN_AI\\Llamaindex_with_gemini\\QA_System\\Data\\virat.txt", "file_name": "virat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19143, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd25cc95-baae-4c05-a8a0-46789f16a22c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\akash\\Learn-GEN_AI\\Llamaindex_with_gemini\\QA_System\\Data\\virat.txt", "file_name": "virat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19143, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "2079d2105dec34d845ab8dbe159fc0d336c49c77482ef105c8a8192d08850cb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2739c15f-2d43-4cac-9c8b-eb79d67e8b3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\akash\\Learn-GEN_AI\\Llamaindex_with_gemini\\QA_System\\Data\\virat.txt", "file_name": "virat.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19143, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "7b120add6de25d9130a92f1b3a39d5722bdd5eec7a808234a8cc26365942320f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad278867-9703-4a5d-893b-7ae1d470f9b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81dd0e2e65568765642d0ba78ac2e2c0a25d62d2e61873bd4500a69fe4cd66b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[50] He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[51] and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[52] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[53] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.[54][55]\r\n\r\nAggression\r\nKohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[56][57] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[58] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike.[59][60] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[61][62] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[63] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[64] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and \"assertiveness\" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.[65]\r\n\r\nPublic image and in media\r\n\r\nVirat Kohli with Audi Q7\r\nIn 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his notable performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli's leadership skills and attitude and saw great potential in the young cricketer.
